# ImageProcessing

For this project, I attempted to create different image processing methods without referencing any algorithms or theory. In other words, I used no reference for this code, and the ideas for algorithms and problem solving I came up with entirely from scratch on my own. I used Python with matplotlib and NumPy because I was already familiar with the absolute basics of how to store and display an image easily. 

In order to use the methods, create a new cell and simply call the desired method with the arguments necessary as stated in the commenting around each method. I've included a sample image, a photo I took in Copenhagen a year ago. I would recommend using the pixelate method to reduce the dimensions of the image before applying other effects (these are not optimized). 

Overall, I am happy with what I was able to accomplish without any reference. My algorithms worked reasonably well considering I was not using optimized algorithms or researched theory, just my own intuition. If I were to continue working on these methods, I'd most likely research some theory for both optimizing these algorithms as well as making their output more effective (especially the edge detection algorithm).
